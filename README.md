# 2048-tile-game
An assignment for shop, using 2d arrays I rebuilt the popular game 2048 with the language java. Players are able to move left, right, up, and down with blocks merging together to one to add up if they are the same value. If not they will all move to the side that was pressed using the arrow keys.
